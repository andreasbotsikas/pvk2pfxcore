If you want to recompile the source then you need the OpenSSL source files.
Edit the Makefile.win32 to point to your OpenSSL include and library files
then, from a VC++ environment just do a:
nmake -f Makefile.win32
This should make the pvk.exe file in the current directory.

For Unix just edit the Makefile and type make.
